			<h3>Assalamu Alaikum Bae.. </h3>
			<p>I beg Allah to reward you for all your good works by making you, as you deserve, the most beautiful girl on the face of the planet.<br> I am glad to see you accomplish success and experience pleasure. May this be the most significant oath in your life.<br> This is the first oath we have spent together since we began dating. Eid is the most significant festival in the world for Muslims since it is a day of love, peace and pleasure.<br> I offer all my love and dedication and all my life's love to you. When I look into your eyes, I can see in your pupils a sparkle of affection.<br>Whenever I meet you, that day is equally as important to me as Eid in celebrating...<br> Today I wish you nothing but the best of luck in the world on that joyful occasion...<br> With nothing but happiness and prosperity, please may your life be blessed. I wish Allah to watch over you always and protect you from any problems which may arise in the future.<br> I want him to lead you on the path to success for the simple reason that I care about you more than anything else in the world.
<br>
  

			 You are my favorite person in the world, Eid Mubarak. With all my heart and soul, I love you.


<br>   <br> Eid Mubarak Queen of Hearts.

			<h3>Assalamu Alaikum Bae and Good morning </h3>
			<p> I must be the luckiest guy alive to have found such a beautiful lady to adore. When I'm around you, I keep pinching myself to be sure what I'm witnessing is genuine. You are everything I've ever needed in my life, and I can't fathom living without you. For the first time in my life, I can't find the right words to describe how I feel. I now understand what it's like to have a crush on a gorgeous woman.<br>
            <br> You're one of my closest friends. The person with whom I can share all of my secrets, with whom I want to talk first when I get up, and with whom I want to speak last before going asleep. When anything great occurs to me, the first person I want to tell is you. When I'm sad or get terrible news, you're the first person I go to for comfort and support. But you're much more to me than a buddy. You are the love of my life. You are a friend, a lover, a comforter, and a source of strength for me. I consider myself extremely fortunate to have you in my life. I just wanted to convey my appreciation for your presence in my life.<br>           <br> You've always been my most steadfast supporter and mediator. You've always had my back, and in your views, there's nothing we can't accomplish, which has improved my self-esteem over the past two years. Thank you for loving me fully and forever, sweetheart! and I shall always adore you completely. People say they desire a woman who will go to any length for her guy. That is something I like in you, and I am grateful for all you have done and continue to do in my life. For the rest of my life, you will be my love.<br>
<br><br>

			
			 Will you be my breath during the trip if I end up drowning in a limitless ocean of thoughts? Will you accompany me all the way back to the surface?


<br>   <br> আমি তোমায় ভালোবাসি, Madam.

			<h3>Baee Lokkhi </h3>
			<p>There is no beginning or end to my adoration for you. It follows a cyclical pattern, much like life itself. It's always moving, much as the waves are. There are no limits to how big it is either; the sky is the limit and the universe is the size of it. When I look into your eyes and see your face, I catch a glimpse of my past, present, and future sewn together. Every part of me expands when I grasp your hand.<br><br> You're my whole world to me. You have my undying love. Please pay attention to what I have to say. You have my heart. I cherish every moment I have with you. And you're the first person I've ever loved this much. I weep over you not because I'm sad, but because I'm so grateful for you that I can't help but show my feelings. I think about you often. I don't think I've ever missed someone as much as I do you. I treasure our friendship. 
<br>
  <br>

			Please stay at my side for the rest of time, I love you.


<br>   <br> You're Lit bae, Angry queen.
