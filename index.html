			<h3>Assalamu Alaikum Bae.. </h3>
			<p>I beg Allah to reward you for all your good works by making you, as you deserve, the most beautiful girl on the face of the planet.<br> I am glad to see you accomplish success and experience pleasure. May this be the most significant oath in your life.<br> This is the first oath we have spent together since we began dating. Eid is the most significant festival in the world for Muslims since it is a day of love, peace and pleasure.<br> I offer all my love and dedication and all my life's love to you. When I look into your eyes, I can see in your pupils a sparkle of affection.<br>Whenever I meet you, that day is equally as important to me as Eid in celebrating... Today I wish you nothing but the best of luck in the world on that joyful occasion...<br> With nothing but happiness and prosperity, please may your life be blessed. I wish Allah to watch over you always and protect you from any problems which may arise in the future.<br> I want him to lead you on the path to success for the simple reason that I care about you more than anything else in the world.
<br>


			 You are my favorite person in the world, Eid Mubarak. With all my heart and soul, I love you.

<br>   <br> Eid Mubarak Queen of Hearts.
